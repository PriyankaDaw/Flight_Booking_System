# ✈️ Flight Booking Management System
A **console-based Java application** that simulates a flight reservation system. Users can search for available flights, book a ticket, view their bookings, and cancel a reservation through a simple and user-friendly text-based interface.

The Flight Booking Management System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate a real-world flight ticket reservation system. It allows users to interact with the system to search available flights, book a ticket, and cancel reservations through a user-friendly.It allows users to interact with the system to search available flights, book a ticket, view existing bookings, and cancel reservations through a user-friendly, menu-driven interface.

This project showcases the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, and methods. It also integrates basic data handling for simulating flight and passenger records, making it an excellent foundational project for understanding how real-life reservation systems work.

🔹 Key Features:
✈️ Flight Search: View available flights based on source and destination.

👤 Booking System: Enter passenger details and confirm seat reservation.

🧾 Ticket Generation: Displays a formatted ticket with emojis, passenger info, and booking ID.

❌ Cancel Bookings: Cancel a reservation using the unique booking ID.

📅 Realistic User Prompts: input-driven interface for ease of use.


🛠️ Technologies Used:
Java (JDK 8 or above) – Core application logic

Object-Oriented Programming – For modular and reusable code

Unicode Emojis – To make console output engaging and user-friendly

✅ Project Objectives:
Practice core Java programming

Apply OOP principles in a real-world scenario

Simulate a simple yet effective command-line reservation system

Provide a foundation for expanding into GUI or database-backed systems
